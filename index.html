        <div class="stanza-1">
            <p>What about days when you feel nothing.</p>
            <p>Waiting in the car, relative arbitration,</p>
            <p>pigeon-pewter or urinal-cake sky, whatever.</p>
            <p>A man shouting, a parade of missiles...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza-2">
            <p>You chew the food and harvest thoughts</p>
            <p>from a seafloor. Control subject,</p>
            <p>a raincoat blurred in close-circuit resolution,</p>
            <p>you pinch the nerveless gummy flesh</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza-3">
            <p>of your elbows and fail to love well.</p>
            <p>You try to carry a flag, at least,</p>
            <p>in the distance. This is not sickness.</p>
            <p>This is not anything. Hand gripping</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza-4">
            <p>the big knife cutting onions. You could</p>
            <p>cut fifty onions this way. You could sleep</p>
            <p>until Easter. Maybe the fog will have lifted</p>
            <p>by then and time will not seem to pass</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza-5">
            <p>like small bones being broken in order.</p>
            <p>Whatâ€™s that sound? Bald human instinct,</p>
            <p>pounding on the windows like a fly.</p>
            <p><em>Who am I?</em> All blown open, paper fold,</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza-6">
            <p>you cannot stop the living obligations,</p>
            <p>debts abstracting in neutral waves.</p>
            <p>Please come back. Patient hearts</p>
            <p>are lining up along the shore.</p>
